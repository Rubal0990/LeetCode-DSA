# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return <i>the level order traversal of its nodes' values</i> (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

## Examples

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
```
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

## Constraints
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
* -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
