# Sqrt(x)
Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return <i>the square root of</i> `x`.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are <b>truncated</b>, and only <b>the integer part</b> of the result is returned.

<b>Note:</b> You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as `pow(x, 0.5)` or `x ** 0.5`.

## Examples
```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```
## Contraints
* 0 <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
